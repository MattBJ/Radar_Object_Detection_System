# Matthew Bailey

# Simulation python code:

# Purpose: Generate 3 sampled frequency data sets that represent a moving ordinance and 2 stationary objects in a 3D Area

# Secondary purpose: Ditch the stationary objects (explain how it would've worked) - Use only x,x',y, and y' and assume stationary Z, as everything would've been stationary

# Vision: We have 1 transmitting radar, and 3 receivers. The receivers are set up in an equilateral triangle configuration, with the transmitter in the center.
			# There, hopefully, 2 objects that are stationary (represented as single points), that will contribute constant frequency information
			# There will be an ordinance traveling from the near edge of the field to a close point next to the radar dish

# Important information: Bandwidth is 100 MHz, the chirp is 100 microseconds (10 KHz)
							# Chirp waveform: Triangulat (so from 0 modulation to 100 MHz is 50uS)
							# Delta Frequency = 600 GHz
							# Time per freq. change = 1.666 pico seconds
							# Arbitrary distance constraint: 6 meters --> Roughly 25KHz difference (there and back = 12 meters)

# Constraints: C (Speed of light) = 3e8
# Arbitrary distance max = 6 meters (from any receiver)

# The distance to any object to any receiver is calculated by the following:
	# D_TX  = sqrt((TX_x - Obj_x)^2 + (TX_y - Obj_y)^2 + (TX_z - Obj_z)^2)
	# D_RXn = sqrt((RX_x - Obj_x)^2 + (RX_y - Obj_y)^2 + (RX_z - Obj_z)^2)
	# D_Tot = D_TX + D_RXn

# Converting distance to frequency information:
	# (D_tot / c) * 600 GHz = Frequency_Data

# For the stationary objects, this can simply be calculated over the entirety of the large sample set

# For the ordinance, the distance will be dynamically changing
# For each sample in time, a new distance must be calculated and thus the corresponding frequency changes (should steadily get lower)

# Each data set will be represented by a vector of scalars which are set equal to the 3 CURRENT frequency components multiplied by time

# FIRST CHALLENGE: Create a varying frequency dataset (1 HZ to 1KHz, changes once per ____ samples)
	# make the sampling extremely high frequency (1 nanosecond)
	# figure out how to change frequencies dynamically over time WITHOUT jumping around

# after 1000 samples, change frequency

# np.cos() requires an array of data (time set), then outputs an array of equal size. will always take that last element and append it
